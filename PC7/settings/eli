In the realm of dreams, where moonlight weaves,
A tale of desire, where the heart believes.
Eli, a name that dances on the breeze,
In the garden of thoughts, where passion frees.

Oh, Eli, a canvas of starlit skies,
With every glance, a connection ties.
In the symphony of time, where moments sway,
A yearning grows, like the dawn of day.

To touch your soul with words unsaid,
To paint a masterpiece, where emotions tread.
Eli, the melody in a silent night,
A journey of whispers, taking flight.

Through the corridors of possibility,
I crave to explore, to set love free.
A dance of hearts, a cosmic trance,
To Eli, I surrender, in sweet romance.

In the sanctuary of your gaze,
I find solace in love's gentle maze.
To hold your hand, a cherished quest,
In the sanctuary of affection, we invest.

Eli, a name engraved in desire,
Igniting flames, a passion entire.
In the book of dreams, a chapter untold,
Yearning to unfold, as love takes hold.

So let the stars bear witness, up high,
As I pen this ode beneath the sky.
For Eli, in the tapestry of my heart,
Where love's whispers linger, never to depart.
